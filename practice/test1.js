//loops
// For loop - When you know how many times
// When we know,exact number of iterations we are going to use


// print your name 10times

// for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
//     console.log('shree')
// }

//  while and Do While

// if you don't know how many iteration we need. in that case we need to use the while loop
// In while loop - We first check the condition then execute


let ip = 0
let house = 100

// while (ip != 100) {
//     ip = ip + 1;
//     console.log('The current count is ' + ip)
// }


// Do while  - We first the run the code then check the condition

do {
    ip = ip + 1;
    console.log('The current count is ' + ip)
    
} while (ip != 100);
